# Fine-Tuning Restormer for Medical Image Denoising

The origin model is [Restormer](https://github.com/swz30/Restormer)   
Fine-tuned by [alsco1234](https://github.com/alsco1234/)

> With the recent development of deep learning technology, a method of removing noise from medical images using neural networks is required. In particular, a technology is needed to remove real noise generated by the irregular flow of electrons in X-ray images without artifacts. Therefore, in this project, the Restoration Transformer (Restoration Transformer) model, which showed excellent performance in the grayscale image denoising task, was improved and applied to medical images. Unlike CNN, Restormer calculates not only local information but also global information, and has the advantage of not limiting the input size. However, there is a disadvantage that the size of the model is large. Considering this, this project reduced the number of blocks of Transformer during fine-tuning and learned only the attention layer, allowing only noise to be removed without creating artifacts.

## Installation

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for the installation of dependencies required to run Restormer.

## Test

To test the Fine-Tuned Restormer models of 512*512 patch. Since Restormer is a model based on transformer, You can set other patch_size and overlap_size editing test.py. but make sure patch size is divided by 8. This code will work in grayscale image (FOR COLOR IMAGE CODE WILL BE SOON)
```
python test.py --origin_path 'PATH_TO_ORIGIN_IMAGE' --noisy_path 'PATH_TO_NOISY_IMAGE'
```
To test the Fine-Tuned Restormer models of one image
```
python test.py --origin_path 'PATH_TO_ORIGIN_IMAGE' --noisy_path 'PATH_TO_NOISY_IMAGE' --prestrained True
```
It prints psnr and ssim between origin and noisy image, both before and after. And also save denoised image.

## Training
